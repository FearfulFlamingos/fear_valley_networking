# Fear Valley Networking

This is the source code for `FearValleyNetworking.dll`, found in both the repositories for the [Fear Valley Client](https://www.github.com/FearfulFlamingos/fear_valley_client) and the [Fear Valley Server](https://www.github.com/FearfulFlamingos/fear_valley_server).

This library contains exclusively class definitions for the network events passed between the client and the server. No actual logic is present, and as such there is no need for unit testing.
